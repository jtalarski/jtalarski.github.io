        <p>If you knew me, you would know that I never shy away from challenging opportunities in my career.  Some of those opportunities came while working with companies that occupied niches in diverse, interesting markets. Those companies include one that sold consumer products to jail and prison commissaries, a team that created a point-of-sale and stock reservation system for furniture stores, and a business cooperative that supported community-owned natural food stores across the country.

            My latest challenge is transitioning to a career as a software development engineer. To do this I started training with Prime Digital Academy in Minneapolis. Prime's approach to training people is a 20 week, intensive and immersive program in which students learn some of the most current and relative technologies and methodologies. At Prime I studied JavaScript, jQuery, React, Express, Node, AJAX and Python.

            watchUwatch is a full-stack application that allows a group of invited users (aka friends) to share lists of streaming media that interest them. The goal for the app is to keep a group of friends apprised of each otherâ€™s current streaming perferences for purposes of finding new media to watch themselves and to generate group discussion.
